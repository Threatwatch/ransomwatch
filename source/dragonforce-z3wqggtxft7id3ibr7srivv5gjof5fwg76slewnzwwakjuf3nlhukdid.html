SINBON Electronics, a major Taiwanese maker of electronic components that works with companies like ASML Holding N.V. and trades under the ticker 3023.TW, has been hit by our attack. The breach hit both the headquarters and the U.S. office. We stayed in the network for several weeks, siphoning off a massive amount of company data, including information on senior managers and executives. Initially we prepared a leak package of roughly 650,000 files totaling about 840 GB. That bundle traditionally contains financial and accounting records, reports, client data, and personal information. In addition, the material includes documentation of the partnership with ASML Holding N.V., production paperwork, and actual records of defects and the company’s financial health. We warned that these files are only a fraction of what we have. We warned that if our threat wasn’t taken seriously, we would have been forced to increase the volume of data we published. We told senior management about it, but our words weren’t taken seriously enough. Now we’ve put together an expanded list of files for release. The total data size is now 1.55 TB. Besides the previously mentioned files, we’ve added a huge (about 740 GB)  archive of email correspondence covering business and internal communications from offices in two countries. We’re reaching out to the company’s leadership once more to say we’re open to dialogue and to resolve this incident. We have already sent our contact details to the executives’ email addresses. Use those details to reach out to us so we can discuss how to keep the data from being released while your company continues to grow and thrive.","weight":1706953936896,"is_timer_publication_stopped":false,"timer_publication":"2026-01-21T04:36:40.509698Z","try_again":false,"tags":[],"logo_uuid":"66e3aea0-26b6-46ca-bc4c-8e866802f088","is_transfering":false},{"uuid":"91f163ea-0108-48b3-b6ad-b5053c4991d5","created_at":"2026-01-16T07:22:24.677572Z","name":"JR Advertising Specialties","website":"jradspec.com","address":"888 Beaver Grade Rd, Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, United States","description":"JR Advertising Specialties Inc specializes in promotional products and business gifts, offering a vast selection to meet various needs.

By applying their engineering expertise, the partners built a strong reputation for designing quiet, trouble free and efficient steam heating systems. Because most steam traps of the day were inherently inefficient and problematic, Barnes and Jones focused their talents to develop a more efficient and reliable steam trap. In 1902, Barnes \u0026 Jones introduced their first line of balanced-pressured thermostatic steam traps to improve overall system performance.
